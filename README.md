Corizo Mini Project

Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a  project made with the help of Neural Network. 
It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits. 

This  project is taken a step further where our handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits ,
but also allows writing digits on the screen with the help of an integrated GUI for recognition. 

We will approach this project by using a three-layered Neural Network. 

The input layer: It distributes the features of our examples to the next layer for calculation of activations of the next layer.

The hidden layer: They are made of hidden units called activations providing nonlinear ties for the network. 
                  A number of hidden layers can vary according to our requirements.
                  
The output layer: The nodes here are called output units. It provides us with the final prediction of the Neural Network on the basis of which 
                  final predictions can be made.
